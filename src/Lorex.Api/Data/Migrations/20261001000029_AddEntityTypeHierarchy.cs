    /// <c>DisplayOrder</c>, so nothing reorders, and nothing is inferred from a name.
    ///
    /// No foreign key, on purpose. SQLite adds one only by rebuilding the table, and a rebuilt <c>EntityTypes</c> becomes the
    /// table SQLite visits first when a universe's delete cascades: its types would go before the entries using them, and the
    /// entries' RESTRICT key would refuse the delete - which happened, and is why this is additive like the content
    /// publication migration. The two guarantees a key would give are triggers instead:
    ///
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>a parent is a type that exists in the same universe, on every insert and on every change of parent or universe;</item>
    /// <item>a type that still has children cannot be deleted - unless its universe is gone, which is a universe's own delete
    /// cascading every type at once (SQLite runs cascades after the universe row is removed).</item>
    /// </list>
    ///
    /// A type is never its own ancestor: a trigger cannot walk a graph (SQLite allows no recursive query in one), so that is
    /// the API's and the restore's, which do. Rolling back drops the triggers, the index and then the column, with SQLite's own
    /// <c>DROP COLUMN</c>: nothing is rebuilt either way. The hierarchy is lost; every type is a root again.
