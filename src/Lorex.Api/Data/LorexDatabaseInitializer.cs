/// runs as a hosted service and queries <c>Entities</c>; before this class, migrations were a
/// statement after <c>builder.Build()</c> that only ran in Development, so any other environment
/// started against an empty file and died with <c>no such table: Entities</c>. The test host ran
/// as "Testing" and was caught by the same gate, which is why it used to migrate itself.
///
/// Ordering is a dependency, not a convention. Callers that need the schema take this singleton
/// and await <see cref="EnsureSchemaAsync"/>; whoever asks first does the work and everyone else
/// awaits the same task. Registration order still puts this first among the hosted services, so
/// in practice the later ones await a task that has already completed - but reordering them
/// cannot reintroduce the bug, and nothing sleeps, polls or retries.
