/// - <c>StorySearchIndex</c> (<c>Kind</c>, <c>ItemId</c>, <c>Title</c>, <c>Summary</c>, <c>Notes</c>): stories (their premise
///   in <c>Summary</c>), chapters, scenes, plot arcs and beats (their description in <c>Summary</c>).
/// - <c>SceneManuscriptSearchIndex</c> (<c>SceneId</c>, <c>Content</c>): each scene's saved prose.
/// - <c>IdeaSearchIndex</c> (<c>IdeaId</c>, <c>Title</c>, <c>Body</c>): every idea, whichever universe it names or none.

/// Prose gets a table of its own so that looking up a scene's title never walks the posting lists of a million words of
/// manuscript; ideas get one because they are the account's, not a story's.
///
/// <b>Kept in step by the database, not by C#.</b> Unlike an entry's article, none of this text needs extracting from a
/// document, so SQLite triggers on each source table write the index inside the statement that changes the text: every
/// create, edit, cascade and future import path is covered at once, a rolled-back write takes its index change with it,
/// and nothing here has to be called from an endpoint. The triggers also turn the two excerpt marker characters into
/// spaces, as <see cref="EntitySearchIndex"/> does for lore.
///
/// <b>The index holds text and nothing else.</b> Whether something is in the Trash, inside something that is, in this
/// universe or owned by this account is answered by joining back to the tables that hold those facts. Trashing and
/// restoring write nothing here and cannot disagree with it.
