/// <b>A rule's words touch nothing.</b> No route passes the Canon promotion gate, reindexes lore or writes an entry,
/// relationship, moment, story, idea or revision, and a rule's words are never read for meaning. A rule that is words only
/// changes nothing else at all; the only other thing its save changes is the universe search's derived copy of the text, written by
/// a trigger (ADR 0031).
///
/// <b>A structured check is the exception, and only it.</b> A rule may carry one explicitly configured check (ADR 0034). Saving,
/// deleting or restoring a rule that has or gets one reconciles Canon Integrity in the same transaction, so the conflict list says
/// what the check now finds when the write lands. Nothing is refused on its account: the check is Medium.

/// <b>No silent overwrite.</b> A save names the <c>updatedAt</c> it was written over; when the rule has moved on since - saved
/// from another tab or device - it is refused with 409 <c>world_rule_changed</c> and nothing is written. The check is part of that
/// save. A save that would change nothing writes nothing.
///
/// <b>Deleted into the Trash, not destroyed.</b> Deleting marks the rule; it leaves every list and route and waits in the
/// universe's Trash, whose restore route (<see cref="RestoreAsync"/>) clears the mark. A rule in the Trash is never checked.
