/// 0033, amended 2026-09-30 and 2026-10-01).
///
/// <b>Only from the Trash.</b> Every row is found through its own universe <i>and</i> requires the marker, so a live id
/// answers like a missing one or another world's. Moving to the Trash stays the only delete anywhere else; nothing reaches
/// this without having gone there first. Typed, as for restore: an id is never guessed at.
///
/// <b>One plan, one row or many.</b> A typed route erases one row; <see cref="BulkDeleteAsync"/> erases a selection of any
/// mix of kinds. Both run <see cref="EraseAsync"/>: the whole selection is resolved first - every row its exact kind, in
/// this universe, in the Trash - and only then is anything written, in one transaction. A row that does not resolve writes
/// nothing at all: a single route answers 404, a selection 409 <see cref="SelectionChangedCode"/>.
///
/// <b>The schema is the ownership graph.</b> Every dependant is a foreign key that already says what it is (see the
/// ADRs): what a row owns cascades with it - an entry's aliases, tags, values, article, both histories, image row,
/// relationships, timeline participation, scene and beat links and idea references; a story's chapters, scenes, arcs and
/// beats with everything they own in turn; a scene's manuscript and its versions; an arc's beats; a rule's check - and a
/// scene's point of view is cleared. So a delete is one statement on the rows themselves, and the database removes the rest
/// in that statement, including owned rows that sit in the Trash on their own (a beat binned before its arc goes with the
/// arc). The search indexes follow through their own delete triggers. Nothing a chapter in the Trash could own remains:
/// its scenes went to Unchaptered when it was binned, so none goes with it.
///
/// <b>Overlap is not a conflict.</b> A selection may hold a story and its own scene, or an arc and its beat: both were
/// resolved before anything was written, so the parent's cascade satisfies the child and the child's own statement then
/// matches nothing. The order of the request never matters - kinds are erased parents first, by set.
///
/// Three things the schema cannot say, and are done here: another entry's reference value pointing at an erased entry is
/// removed rather than left empty (a write never stores an empty reference); a moment's validation details that named only
/// an erased entry as participant are removed, as clearing all three parts of them does on a save; and a recorded Canon
/// finding naming what was erased is forgotten, whatever its status - it can never be true or false again.
///
/// <b>No Canon gate.</b> Nothing erased here contributes facts while it is in the Trash, so erasing it cannot add a
/// finding. A selection holding an entry still reconciles once (<see cref="CanonPromotionGate.RecordAsync"/>) because it
/// rewrites live rows the rules read - other entries' references, moments' participants - and the conflict table must
/// describe the lore that is left, in the same transaction. Story content contributes nothing (ADR 0024); a rule in the
/// Trash is not checked, so erasing it leaves every live finding as it was.
///
/// <b>An image goes after the commit.</b> Its object keys are read first, the database is changed and committed, and only
/// then are the originals and thumbnails swept - so nothing ever names a deleted object. A sweep that fails is logged as
/// orphaned media and changes nothing (ADR 0019): the entry is gone either way.
