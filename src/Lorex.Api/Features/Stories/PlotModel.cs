/// and in what order; an arc is a development the author means to track across that telling. It owns no
/// scene, asserts nothing about the world and never becomes Canon. Lorex reads nothing into its title: there

/// not by its first scene, a chapter, a date or its title. The number shown ("Arc 2") is that position plus
/// one, worked out when it is drawn and never stored.

/// Owned by the story and deleted with it. Deleting an arc moves it to the Trash with its beats and their
