/// Refuses the one write that would introduce a provable contradiction, and nothing else.
///
/// High severity finally means something: a mutation may not <em>add</em> a High finding to
/// a universe. What it deliberately does not mean is that a universe holding a High conflict
/// is frozen. A world with one impossible lifespan in it must still be editable everywhere
/// else, or the gate stops being a guard rail and becomes a lock on work the author is in the
/// middle of. So the comparison is a difference, never a count: the High fingerprints present
/// before the write are collected, the write is applied, the High fingerprints present after
/// it are collected, and only a fingerprint in the second set and not the first is a reason to
/// refuse. An unrelated edit leaves that difference empty and goes through, with the
/// pre-existing conflict untouched.
///
/// A fingerprint is the right unit for this. It is derived from the rule code and the ids of
/// the facts that disagree, so the same problem survives a rename and a materially different
/// problem is a different key - exactly the identity the recorded conflicts already use.
/// Comparing counts would let a write swap one contradiction for another unnoticed.
///
/// Evaluating the candidate means the candidate has to exist first. The rules read the
/// database, not the change tracker, so there is no way to ask them about lore that has only
/// been staged in memory. The write is therefore applied for real inside a transaction that is
/// rolled back when the answer comes back bad, which is what makes a refusal atomic from the
/// caller's side: the lore is exactly as it was, and the recorded conflicts are untouched too,
/// because detection is all that runs before the decision. A rejected candidate opens,
/// resolves and reopens nothing on its way out.
///
/// An accepted candidate is the opposite case and needs the opposite treatment. It is the lore
/// now, so the conflict table has to describe it: the candidate findings - already in hand, and
/// not gathered again - are reconciled through the ordinary evaluator, inside the same
/// transaction, before the commit. Lore and conflicts therefore move together or not at all,
/// and every lifecycle rule stays exactly where it was written, because this is the same
/// reconciliation <c>POST /evaluate</c> runs.
