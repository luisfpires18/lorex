/// A Canon relationship whose two ends were born further apart, or closer together, than its type
/// allows.
///
/// The gap is the distance between the two declared birth years, in years, as
/// <see cref="Chronology.UniverseChronology.YearsBetween"/> measures it - the chronology's own answer,
/// never arithmetic on era labels done here. It is absolute: which end is older is the age order's
/// question, not this one's, so a type may bound the gap with or without an order, and a relationship
/// that breaks both is two separately fixable findings.
///
/// Birth years are whole years, and the gap is a gap between years, not between birthdays. Nothing
/// here claims an exact age. It stays provable anyway: two years 8 apart are less than 12 years apart
/// however the birthdays fall, and two years 31 apart are more than 30.
///
/// Stands down whenever the distance is not known - most often two years in eras whose lengths the
/// universe does not record. Their order may still be certain, and the age order rule still reads it.
///
/// Medium, for the same reason as <see cref="CanonRelationshipAgeOrderRule"/>: the bound is a
/// constraint an author configured, not a law Lorex can see.
