/// <c>CANON-FAMILY-001</c>: Canon parent links that go round in a circle, so that entries are recorded as their own ancestors
/// (ADR 0035).
///
/// Reads only what an author configured: relationships whose type carries a family meaning, on the stored direction - source
/// parent, target child. A type's name is never read, so "father of" with no family meaning is invisible here, and a type called
/// anything at all with one is read as a parent link. Biological and adoptive links count alike: either way the entry above is a
/// parent.
///
/// Canon only, as the other relationship rules are: a link that is not Canon, or an end that is not Canon or is in the Trash, is
/// not yet a claim about the world, and leaves the circle open. One finding per circle - a strongly connected group, with every
/// link between its members - rather than one per elementary cycle, whose number can grow exponentially; fingerprinted over
/// those links as a set, so the same circle is the same finding after a restore's new ids, and a link added to it is a new one.
///
/// Medium, not High. A circle is impossible for ordinary ancestry, but a world with time travel or rebirth may mean exactly that,
/// and Lorex cannot tell which without reading words - so it is reported, never refused, and nothing is rewritten. The family
/// tree names the circles it can see itself, whatever the links' status.
