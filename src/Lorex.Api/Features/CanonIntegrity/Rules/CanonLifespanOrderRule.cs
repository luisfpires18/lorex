/// whose author never said which field is the birth year is invisible to this rule, which
/// is the point - meaning is declared, never guessed from a name.

/// facts cannot both be true, whatever the calendar.

/// The boundary is deliberately not an error. Birth year equal to death year is an infant
/// death, which is ordinary lore, so only a strictly later birth is reported.
