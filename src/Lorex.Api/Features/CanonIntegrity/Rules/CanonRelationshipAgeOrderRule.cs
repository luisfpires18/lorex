/// <summary>
/// A Canon relationship whose two ends were born in the wrong order for its type.
///
/// Nothing here knows what any relationship means. The order is the one an author configured on
/// the relationship type - source older, or source younger - so a type named "parent of" with no
/// rule is as invisible to this as one named "banana", and "banana" configured with a rule is
/// checked exactly like "parent of" would be. The stored direction is read once per relationship,
/// so a link shown from both of its entries is still one finding.
///
/// Only a strictly wrong order is reported. A birth year is a whole year, so two entries born in the
/// same year may have been born either way round, and that proves nothing.
///
/// Medium, not High. The lifespan rules are High because dying before being born is impossible in
/// any world. This rule enforces a constraint someone wrote on a type, and Lorex cannot tell a law
/// of that world from a convention of the author's without reading the type's name - which is the
/// one thing it must not do. So a breach is reported, and never refused.
