/// Unicode address was the alternative and was refused: mixed-direction text and look-alike
/// letters are how an address is made to read as another one. The name itself is never changed
/// for the address; it is shown exactly as written.</para>

/// <para><b>Unique in its namespace, and deterministic.</b> A universe's across Lorex; an entry's among its
/// universe's entries, a story's among its universe's stories - an entry and a story may share one, since they
/// live under different route segments. The first to take a stem has it; the next gets <c>-2</c>, then
/// <c>-3</c>, whatever is free at the moment it is published - an item in the Trash keeps its address, so it is
/// still taken. No account, id or clock is in it.</para>
