/// R2 is not S3. Three of the places it differs are settled in <see cref="MediaSetup"/>, not

/// The bucket is private. Nothing in this class makes an object public, sets an ACL, or hands
/// out a URL that points at Cloudflare - reads go through Lorex's own authenticated route, so
/// the credentials and the endpoint never leave the server. See ADR 0019.
///
/// Every SDK failure leaves this class as a <see cref="MediaStorageFailedException"/> carrying
/// Lorex's own sentence, so an R2 error response can never reach a caller - or a client - as a
/// raw <see cref="AmazonS3Exception"/>. The provider's own message survives only as the inner
/// exception, for the log.
