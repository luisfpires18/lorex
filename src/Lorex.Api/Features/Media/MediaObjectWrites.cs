/// written, under an asset id nothing is using. Neither write depends on the other's result, and
/// neither can be read by anything until the database moves, which happens after both have

/// <para><b>What does not change.</b> The failure contract is exactly the one the sequential
/// version had, because it was already written for "the first may have landed before the second
/// did not": on any failure the caller sweeps every key it was writing, and a delete of an object
/// that was never written succeeds. Concurrency only widens which of the two might be the one that
/// landed, and the caller already made no assumption about that.</para>
