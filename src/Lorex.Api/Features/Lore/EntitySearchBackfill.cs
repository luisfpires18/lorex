/// Fills the search index for entries that have no row in it, once, at startup.
///
/// This is how lore written before full-text search existed becomes findable, and how a future
/// change to what is indexed gets picked up: the migration that changes the index empties the
/// table, and the next start rebuilds it. It is not a maintenance command and not a button in
/// Settings - an index the author has to remember to rebuild is an index that quietly lies about
/// what a universe contains.
///
/// Runs before the first request is served, and does one query when there is nothing to do. It
/// waits on <see cref="LorexDatabaseInitializer"/> first, because it reads <c>Entities</c> and a
/// schema is not something startup work may assume. It still fails loudly if the tables are not
/// there afterwards, because a start that carried on would answer every search with an error
/// instead.
