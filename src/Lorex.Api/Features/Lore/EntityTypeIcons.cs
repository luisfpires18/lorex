/// The icons an entity type may carry: a closed set of keys, each naming one picture the client
/// draws from its own built-in icon set.
///
/// A key is only a picture. It says nothing about what a type is - a crown can mark a kingdom, a
/// dynasty or a card game - and nothing reads it but the screen that draws it. It is never inferred
/// from a type's name either: a type called "Kingdom" has no icon until its author picks one.
///
/// Closed because the client can only draw what it ships, and an unknown key would render as
/// nothing on one screen and as something else on the next. It is not an upload, a URL or markup,
/// which is also what keeps it out of every question about sanitising.
///
/// The first seven are the keys the starter types have always been seeded with, kept under their
/// original names so every stored type and every backup already written still names a real icon.
/// Keys added since name the picture itself. A key, once shipped, is never renamed or removed: it
/// is stored and exported. See <c>docs/architecture/decisions/0020-entity-type-icon-keys.md</c>.
