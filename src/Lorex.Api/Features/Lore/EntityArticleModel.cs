/// An entry's article: the long-form prose that describes it, beside the structured lore the entry itself holds.
///
/// The entry's name, summary, type, status, aliases, tags and field values are structured lore - what Lorex can compare,
/// filter and check. The article is what the author writes about it. The two differ in size and in how often they are
/// written, so they are different rows: a structured edit, a Canon promotion, a trash or a restore loads and writes the
/// entry without a word of its article, and saving the article writes nothing structured. <see cref="LoreEntity"/> has no
/// navigation back to it for the same reason.
///
/// <b>Stored as the editor writes it.</b> <see cref="Content"/> is the Tiptap document, validated structurally on the way
/// in by <see cref="LoreContent"/>, or <c>""</c> for an article that was written and then cleared. It is never parsed for
/// meaning: no field, relationship, timeline entry or Canon finding comes from a sentence in it, and it has no status of
/// its own - it is as settled as the entry it belongs to.
///
/// At most one per entry, keyed by the entry and deleted with it. An entry with no row has no article; the row appears on
/// the first save that writes something. See <c>docs/architecture/decisions/0028-entity-article.md</c>.
