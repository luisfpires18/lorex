/// second row rather than trusting every write path to remember, and an entry without one is
/// the absence of a row rather than six nulls on the busiest table in the product.

/// It holds identifiers, never a URL. The object keys are stored as written rather than
/// recomputed from the convention, so changing the convention later cannot orphan what is
/// already in the bucket - the row keeps pointing at the objects it actually created.
///
/// Cascades with the entry, which is why the Trash needs no special case: trashing marks
/// <see cref="LoreEntity.DeletedAt"/> and deletes nothing, so this row is untouched and a
/// restore reconnects the image with nothing to rebuild.
