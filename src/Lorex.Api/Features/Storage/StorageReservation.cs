/// It exists because the database cannot hold a write transaction open across the object store: the check runs in
/// one short transaction, the bytes go to the bucket with no transaction open, and the association commits in a
/// second. Without a hold, two uploads could both pass the check before either committed. With one, the second check
/// sees the first upload's bytes already spoken for.

/// at <see cref="ExpiresAt"/> whatever happened - so a process that dies mid-upload cannot keep an account's space
/// forever. Not part of any universe, so never in a backup. See ADR 0042.
