/// Relationships between entities. One row per link: the reverse reading is derived at read
/// time from the relationship type, never stored as a second row. Every route proves
/// universe ownership first, then re-resolves every client id inside that universe, so no
/// id crosses a universe boundary and nothing another owner holds is ever disclosed.
///
/// These writes are reconciled but not gated, which is the distinction Phase 014 turns on.
/// The rules that read relationships are all Medium: <c>CANON-REL-001</c>, because a Canon link
/// resting on a draft endpoint is a loose end rather than an impossibility, and
/// <c>CANON-REL-002</c> and <c>CANON-REL-003</c>, because a breached age constraint is a breach of
/// a rule the author configured, which Lorex cannot tell from a law of the world (ADR 0023). The
/// three High rules read declared years and Canon moments, neither of which a relationship can
/// touch. So no relationship write can introduce a High finding and there is nothing here to
/// refuse; gating anyway would sweep the rules a second time per write to prove an empty set. The
/// moment a High rule does read a relationship - exclusivity overlap is the obvious candidate,
/// and it needs schema that does not exist yet - these routes swap <c>RecordAsync</c> for
/// <c>RunAsync</c> and nothing else changes.
///
/// Reconciling is a separate question from gating, and the answer here is yes: a Medium
/// finding is still a finding, and the conflict table has to describe the relationship that
/// was just written rather than the one that was there before.
///
/// One link is stored once. A create or an edit that would leave two rows saying the same thing is
/// refused as 409 <c>relationship_already_exists</c> - see <see cref="FindDuplicateAsync"/> for what
/// "the same thing" is. It is enforced here rather than by a unique index, because every database
/// written before this rule existed may already hold duplicates an author authored, and no migration
/// of ours is going to delete those to make an index fit. So this route is the rule, and it is the
/// only way a relationship is ever created: the entry's Relations view and the family tree's Add
/// connection both post here, and a restore deliberately does not, so a backup written before the
/// rule still restores exactly as it always did.
///
/// What that costs, and it is the whole cost: two creates racing each other can both read no
/// duplicate and both write. SQLite takes one writer at a time, so the window is the gap between this
/// read and that write, on a database one person is authoring into. A duplicate that does land is a
/// stored row like any other - shown, editable, removable, and drawn once by a family tree.
