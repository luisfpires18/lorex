/// The families a universe already holds, worked out from its family links and nothing else (ADR 0035 amendment, 035).
///
/// A family is one connected group of live entries joined by links whose kind has a family meaning - a parent of either kind
/// or a non-structural one - read without direction: who is whose parent matters to the tree, not to who belongs together. It is
/// a view of the relationships, never a record of its own: there is no family row, id or name, and the same links always group
/// the same way.
///
/// A group is offered only if at least one member's type is enabled for the Family Tree, because the page opens the tree on
/// such a member, as its picker would. Every member counts towards its size all the same: a relative whose type was disabled is
/// still family. Pure: the endpoint hands it what it read, and it reads nothing.
