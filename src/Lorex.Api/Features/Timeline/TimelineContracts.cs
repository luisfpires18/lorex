/// plain signed years with an optional label, exactly as before eras existed.

/// details: left out (null), a create links none and an update keeps what is stored, so a client that knows nothing of
/// stories cannot erase them; a list, empty included, is the whole set. A story already linked and since put in the Trash
/// may be sent back and stays linked; a story in the Trash cannot be newly linked.
