/// Azure App Service terminates TLS and forwards plain HTTP to the container, so without this
/// every request looks like <c>http</c> from inside: a Secure session cookie would be dropped
/// and any absolute URL the app builds would be wrong.
///
/// Only <c>X-Forwarded-Proto</c> is honoured, and only when configuration turns this on. The
/// proxy's address is not known ahead of time on App Service, so the known-network and
/// known-proxy lists have to be cleared - which means a client talking to the app directly
/// could claim any scheme. That is acceptable for exactly one header whose only effect is to
/// make the app stricter (an <c>https</c> claim adds Secure, it never removes it), and is why
/// <c>X-Forwarded-For</c> is deliberately not forwarded: nothing here reads the client address,
/// so accepting a spoofable one would buy nothing.
