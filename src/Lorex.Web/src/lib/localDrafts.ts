/**
 * Recovery copies of unsaved writing, kept in this browser and nowhere else.
 *
 * A recovery copy is not a save. It never reaches the API, never becomes a saved version, never moves a timestamp and
 * never appears in a backup: it exists so that writing lost before a save - a crash, a closed tab, a dead battery - can
 * be offered back the next time the same account opens the same article or manuscript. Saving stays explicit (ADR 0029).
 *
 * IndexedDB, not `localStorage`: an article is up to 200,000 characters of document and a manuscript up to a million, and
 * `localStorage` is a few megabytes for the whole site, synchronous on the main thread, and fails a write by throwing
 * mid-keystroke. IndexedDB takes large strings asynchronously under a quota the browser sizes to the disk.
 *
 * Every copy is keyed by the signed-in account, the universe, what it is and the id it belongs to, and is handed back
 * only to that same account. Signing out destroys nothing - that would defeat recovery - and another account on the
 * same browser is never offered one. No credential, token or cookie is ever stored here: the account's id is a key,
 * nothing more.
 *
 * Storage can be missing, full or refused. Every function here fails as a rejected promise and nothing else, so an
 * editor can carry on writing and saving without it.
