 * One multipart upload, with the one thing `fetch` cannot give: how much of the body has actually
 * left the browser.
 *
 * `fetch` has no upload-progress event. A request body can be a stream whose pulls are countable,
 * but that is not wired to `FormData`, needs HTTP/2 and duplex support, and is not something to
 * build the only upload in the product on. `XMLHttpRequest` has had `upload.onprogress` for
 * fifteen years, so this is the one place Lorex uses it - a focused helper for the one endpoint
 * that sends a photo, not a replacement for `apiFetch`.
 *
 * Everything else is deliberately identical to `apiFetch`: same-origin, the session cookie the
 * browser already holds, `Accept: application/json`, no `Content-Type` (the FormData boundary is
 * the browser's), 204 as `undefined`, and a failure as the same `ApiError` with the same field
 * errors and code - see `apiErrorFrom`.
 *
 * `onProgress` reports the browser's own byte counts and is called once more with a full ratio
 * when the body is away. After that the request is in the server's hands and no number is
 * available or honest, which is why the caller switches to an indeterminate state rather than
 * pretending the last few percent are still moving.
