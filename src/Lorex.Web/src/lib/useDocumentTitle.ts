 * The tab's title while a screen is shown: its parts, most specific first, then the brand, all joined by a bar -
 * "Lore | Hollowmere | Lorex". With no parts, the brand alone. Put back when the screen goes.
 *
 * One hook for the whole of Lorex, and one owner per screen. On the portal that is the page itself, in the same words
 * the server writes into the page's head (ADR 0038), so a page reached by a link inside the app reads as one reached
 * from outside. In the workspace it is the shell: the account-level layout names Universes, Ideas or Profile, and a
 * universe's shell names the section and the universe. Nothing beneath a shell sets one, so two never race.
