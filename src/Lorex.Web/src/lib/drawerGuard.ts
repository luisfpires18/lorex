 * The unsaved-changes guard for a drawer form: while `isDirty`, every way out of the app asks `message` first, through
 * `useLeaveGuard` - a link, Sign out, the browser's Back and Forward, a reload or a closed tab - and leaving anyway closes
 * the drawer, so nothing of the draft is still open under the next page.
 *
 * `close` is the drawer's own close - Cancel, Escape and a press on the backdrop - which asks once, only when there is
 * something to lose, and closes without asking again: the drawer closing takes its leave question with it. `dialogProps`
 * go on the `<dialog>` and route Escape and the backdrop through it.
 *
 * Escape is taken on its key press rather than from the dialog's `cancel` event: a browser may refuse to let a second
 * `cancel` in a row be prevented, and would then close the dialog under a form it still holds. A key press whose default
 * something inside already took - a picker closing its list - is left alone.
