/**
 * The Lorex symbol: three interlocking rings around a star, the owner's own artwork.
 *
 * Always decorative, and always beside the `Wordmark`, which is what carries the name. A screen
 * reader that announced both would say "Lorex Lorex" - so this is hidden and the text is the
 * identity. If the mark ever stands alone somewhere, that place gives it its own accessible name
 * rather than this component guessing one.
 *
 * A raster, not an inline SVG: the artwork is a shaded render and tracing it to vectors would be
 * redrawing it. The same master produces every install icon - see `scripts/render-icons.py`.
 *
 * Transparent, so it sits on the graphite plate and on paper without a tile behind it. It is not
 * used in the workspace rail: at the ~24px the rail allows, the dark two-thirds of the artwork
 * disappear into the plate and what is left is not a symbol. The rail keeps its drawn `L`.
