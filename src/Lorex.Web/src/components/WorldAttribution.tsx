 * Who a public world is by (ADR 0039). A world of its author's own: "by" its author. A world based on someone else's work:
 * "Based on works by" the original creator - and the work, when named - then "Curated on LoreX by" its author, and a
 * restrained note that it is an unofficial fan or reference project. The original creator is a name and nothing more: it
 * never links anywhere, since no Lorex account is theirs. Only the Lorex author links, to their author page.
 *
 * `testId` prefixes the author link's test id, as each page named it before (`public-world-author`, `public-story-author`).
