 * cannot drift apart again the way three copies of one header did.
 *
 * The bar says which side of Lorex this is and what is on it. The brand leads to Explore, as everywhere (014). Then the
 * workspace by name, and its two places, Universes and Ideas, the one that is open marked as the current page - by a
 * rule along the bar's foot as well as by ink, never by colour alone. Profile is not a tab: it is the account's, reached
 * from the account menu, and on it neither tab is current. Explore, the other side of Lorex, at the end beside the
 * account; on a phone it leaves the bar, because the account menu's "Go to" already holds it, and the workspace takes a
 * row of its own rather than being squeezed into one.
 *
 * A universe is not drawn in this frame. It is one level deeper and keeps its own rail and sidebar, with All universes
 * at the head of the sidebar as the way back up.
