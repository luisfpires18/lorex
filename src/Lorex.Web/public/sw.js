/*
  Lorex service worker.

  It exists for one reason: a page needs a registered worker with a fetch handler before a
  browser will offer to install it. Everything it does beyond that is deliberately small,
  because Lorex is a server-backed, authenticated product and there is no offline design.

  What it caches: same-origin GET requests for build output and root static files only.
  Vite gives every built asset a content hash, so those URLs are immutable and cache-first
  is safe - a changed file is a changed URL.

  What it never touches, by construction rather than by convention:

    - /api/** and /health      private, per-user, and often a mutation
    - anything that is not GET
    - navigation requests       so index.html is always fresh and nobody can be stranded
                                on a frontend build that no longer matches the API
    - cross-origin requests
    - the web app manifest      the browser reads the installed app's start_url, scope and
                                id from it; a kept copy froze all three once (UI refinement
                                014), and it is never cached again

  Those requests are not passed to respondWith at all, so the browser handles them exactly
  as it would with no worker installed. Nothing authenticated is ever written to a cache.

  Consequence, stated plainly: Lorex does not work offline. Opening it without a network
  fails the same way it does in a normal tab. That is the intended behaviour, not a gap.

  Update policy: none to follow by hand. The app registers this file as /sw.js?build=<id>,
  the id being the build's own (src/lib/buildInfo.ts), and the cache is named after it. A new
  build is a new script URL, so the browser installs a new worker; it takes over immediately
  (skipWaiting plus clients.claim) and deletes every other Lorex cache on activate. Root files
  that keep their names across builds - the icons, brand-mark.png - are therefore fetched
  afresh once per build rather than pinned to the first one a browser saw. Since navigations
  are never cached, the next load already carries the new asset URLs, so no update prompt is
  needed.

  Registered without a build id - only a test does that, against the dev server - the cache
  is lorex-static-unbuilt, which no production registration can be.
