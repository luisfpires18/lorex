"""
Renders every install and favicon asset from `assets/brand/lorex-icon.png`, which is the
only source of the mark.

    python scripts/render-icons.py

The mark is the owner's artwork and is never redrawn here. All this does is trim it to its
own edges, place it on a square canvas with the padding each use needs, resample it down,
and write a PNG. Nothing recolours it and nothing traces it.

Standard library only, still. Downscaling a 1299x1211 master by four to eighty times is an
area average - each output pixel is the mean of the source rectangle it covers - which is
the correct filter for a reduction this large and is about thirty lines. Alpha is
premultiplied before averaging and divided out afterwards, so the transparent margin cannot
bleed dark fringes into the mark's edges.

Two grounds, and the reason for each:

  transparent  What the master is, and the default. The mark's lit red rings carry its shape
               on a light or a dark surface alike; its dark side simply merges into a dark
               one, which reads as a lit sphere rather than as a defect. Checked at 16px on
               a browser's own dark and light tab greys.
  paper        `--paper`, #f6f2ea, which is also the manifest's background_color. Used only
               where transparency is not an option:

               - the maskable icon, which a platform crops to its own shape and fills, and
                 where a transparent region is a defect rather than a choice;
               - the Apple touch icon, because iOS composites transparency onto black, and
                 the mark is mostly very dark red - 62% of its opaque pixels sit below
                 luminance 40 - so on black most of it would not be there at all.

A paper tile behind the favicon was tried first, for that same 62%. It is legible but it is
a pale box sitting in a dark tab strip, which is worse than the thing it was solving.
