# ASP.NET Core guidance (Lorex)

Conventions for `src/Lorex.Api`. Follow these over generic tutorial patterns.

## Structure

- One feature per folder: `Features/<Feature>/`.
- A feature owns its endpoints, request/response records, handlers and
  `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` classes. `LorexDbContext` picks configurations up
  automatically via `ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly`.
- Register endpoints with an extension method named `Map<Feature>Endpoints`, called
  from `Program.cs`. Keep `Program.cs` a list of registrations, not logic.
- No `Repository<T>`, no `IXxxService` wrapper per entity. Inject `LorexDbContext`.
  Extract a class only when there is real behaviour, and keep it inside the feature.

## Endpoints

- Minimal APIs. Return `TypedResults`/`Results` with explicit status codes.
- Bind request bodies to `sealed record` types declared next to the endpoint.
- Validate at the edge and return `Results.ValidationProblem`; never let invalid
  input reach EF Core.
- Name endpoints with `.WithName(...)` so OpenAPI and tests can reference them.

## EF Core

- `LorexDbContext` is the only context. Do not add a second one.
- Reads that do not feed an update use `AsNoTracking()`.
- Project to DTOs in the query (`Select`) rather than loading entities and mapping.
- Never call `EnsureCreated()`. Schema changes go through migrations:
  `dotnet dotnet-ef migrations add <Name> --project src/Lorex.Api --output-dir Data/Migrations`
- Migrations are applied automatically in `Development` only (`DatabaseSetup`).
- SQLite has no `decimal` support worth relying on and limited `ALTER TABLE`; check
  the generated migration before committing it.

## Configuration and secrets

- `appsettings.json` holds non-secret defaults only. The `LorexDb` connection string
  there is intentionally empty.
- Development values go in `appsettings.Development.json` (committed, no secrets).
- Anything secret goes in user secrets (`dotnet user-secrets`, id `lorex-api-dev`)
  or environment variables. Never commit a secret, key, token or password.

## Async and cancellation

- Async all the way. Every EF Core call takes the endpoint's `CancellationToken`.
- No `.Result`, no `.Wait()`, no `async void`.

## Tests

- Integration tests use `LorexApiFactory` (`tests/Lorex.Api.Tests`), which boots the
  real host against in-memory SQLite. Prefer them over mocking the pipeline.
- Test through HTTP where a feature is reachable over HTTP.
- Test method names use `Snake_case_sentences`; CA1707 is suppressed in that project.

## Auth

- ASP.NET Core Identity with the application cookie, wired in `Features/Auth/AuthSetup.cs`.
  See `docs/architecture/decisions/0005-cookie-authentication.md`.
- Endpoints are anonymous unless they call `.RequireAuthorization()`. There is no
  fallback policy, so every authenticated endpoint must opt in explicitly.
- Never expose an Identity entity. Map to a record in `Features/Auth/AuthContracts.cs`
  or the feature's own contracts.
- Sign-in failures return one uniform response. Do not add messages that distinguish an
  unknown account from a wrong password.
- Do not hand-roll password hashing, cookie signing or token issuing.
