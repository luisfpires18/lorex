/**
 * How many browsers run at once.
 *
 * `LOREX_E2E_WORKERS`, when it is a whole number above zero, decides - locally and in CI alike, so
 * the workflow states its concurrency where it is run (`ci.yml` asks for two). Without it, CI falls
 * back to one, the conservative floor, and a local run gets Playwright's own default: half the
 * logical processors.
 *
 * That local default was measured rather than assumed. Against a database the suite made itself,
 * the full 155 at eight workers came back green three runs out of three with no SQLite contention
 * at all; against a copy of a long-lived development one it lost tests and logged `database is
 * locked` in both runs, and halving the workers changed neither, at 1.7x the wall clock. So a
 * fresh database (`LOREX_E2E_DB`, below) is the condition parallel browsers depend on, and CI
 * always gives itself one. Two workers sharing one API and one fresh database is how every full
 * run since 008 has been proved locally; the numbers, and why CI stops at two, are in `README.md`.

 * run starts from an empty file the startup migration builds, which is the only way to compare
 * one run against another and the way to keep authored work out of the way of the tests.
