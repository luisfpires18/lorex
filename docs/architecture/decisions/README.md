# Architecture decisions

One ADR per durable decision. Rationale lives in the ADR, never here.

All accepted. Next number: `0035`.

Known limitations are recorded in the ADR that owns them - cross-era ordering on the plain
reckoning in 0009 and 0011, and years written before a universe named its eras, the listing's
join and the missing era reassignment in 0022, the `Age` reference year and exclusive-relationship overlap in 0011, what the
promotion gate does not claim about stored High conflicts in 0012, unbounded history
growth in 0013, what a backup is not in 0014, the type that cannot be freed while a
trashed entry still uses it in 0015, the loss of substring matching in 0016, what an
installed Lorex does not do offline in 0017, and what the DEV topology costs - one
writer, an outage on deploy, keys unencrypted at rest and no rollback for the schema -
in 0018, and what an entry's image costs a backup and a revision restore in 0019, and what a
profile photo is deliberately left out of - a backup, a history and anyone else's view - in
0021, and the deferred life-state constraints and the gap across eras of unrecorded length in 0023, and
what stories deliberately do not have yet - prose, history, search, a Trash, Canon checks - in
0024, and what chapters leave for later - acts and volumes, drag-and-drop, collapsing - in 0025, and what plot
leaves for later - a status, beat chronology, visual planning, editing beats from a scene - in 0026, and what a manuscript
leaves for later - formatting, revisions, autosave, search - and what a whole-text save costs, in
0027, and what an entry article's history costs and leaves for later - plain text, diffs, pruning, restoring article text
from entry versions recorded before it - and the excerpt's marker characters, in 0028, and what content recovery deliberately
does not do - permanent deletion, versions of short text and structure, drafts for forms, syncing drafts between devices, and
restoring a chapter with the scenes it once held - in 0029, and what ideas deliberately do not have - promotion into lore, statuses,
versions, cross-universe references - and the unassigned ideas no universe backup can hold, in 0030, and what the universe
search leaves out - account-wide search, unassigned ideas, substrings, a pinned bar, the triggers the model cannot see - in 0031, and
what a restore does not do - overwrite, merge, account-wide or partial restores, background jobs - and the writer lock a very large
one holds, in 0032, and what a world rule deliberately is not - ordered, prioritised, versioned or read for meaning - in 0033, and
what a rule's check deliberately is not - a second pattern, a builder, a condition tree, a diagnostic finding, a stale-save token for
moments - and that it is only as complete as the details authors record, in 0034.
