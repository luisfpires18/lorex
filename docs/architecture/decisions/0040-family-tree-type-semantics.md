# ADR 0040 - A type may be enabled for the Family Tree, and a relation kind may mean family without ancestry

Status: accepted (2026-09-30). Supersedes two statements of ADR 0035, named below; the rest of 0035 stands.

## Context

Real use - a Lord of the Rings pilot - found three problems with ADR 0035 as built.

- **Every entry was offered a family.** 0035 said "entry types mean nothing here", so `Species → Men` had a Family tree
  action and the tree's picker offered every location, item and species in the world beside the people.
- **Only parents existed.** An author could not record "Bilbo uncle of Frodo" as family at all. The only family meanings
  were `BiologicalParent` and `AdoptiveParent`, and faking an uncle as a parent link would invent an ancestry.
- **Types was one long mixed page.** Lore types, relation kinds and event kinds and methods ran one under another, with a
  permanently open "New type" form in the middle.

## Decision

**Family Tree eligibility is explicit type metadata.** `EntityTypes.FamilyTreeEligible`, a boolean, set by the author on
the Types screen (Lore Types tab, and in the New type dialog). It decides where the Family Tree is *offered*: the tree's
entry picker (`GET .../entities?familyTreeEligible=true`, the same listing and search every picker uses, filtered on the
type's column) and the Family tree action on an entry's page. Nothing reads a type's name or icon to decide it, at run
time or anywhere else.

*This supersedes 0035's "Entry types mean nothing here" and "Every entry's page offers Family tree".*

**Only the starter Character is seeded eligible.** `EntityTypeDefaults` carries the flag as data beside each starter's
icon; Character is `true`, the other six `false`. A starter re-seeded into an existing universe (the seeding fills in
missing names) is created the same way.

**Existing universes: one exact rule.** Migration `AddEntityTypeFamilyTreeEligibility` adds the column as `false` and
turns it on only for a row that is still the starter Character exactly as seeded: name `Character`, description
`People, and anything else with a will of its own.`, icon `character`, colour `#4f6bd6`. A starter the author renamed,
redescribed, re-iconed or recoloured is theirs and stays off; so does every custom type, including one merely called
"Character" in another universe. `EntityTypeDefaults.IsUntouchedStarterCharacter` is the same rule in code, used to read
older backups, so both upgrade paths agree. Anything ambiguous stays off and the author turns it on.

**Legacy family data stays reachable.** Eligibility gates where the tree is offered, never what an entry may hold. The
tree endpoint answers for any live entry of the universe, as before, and says whether each node's type is eligible
(`entityTypeFamilyTreeEligible`), so the page shows *This entry's type is not currently enabled for Family Tree* with a
link to Lore Types rather than hiding anything. An entry's detail carries `hasFamilyConnections` - a live link of a
family kind touches it - and its page offers Family tree when that is true whatever its type. Nothing is rewritten or
deleted, and an ineligible entry is not added to the picker because some entry of its type was once in a family.

**Parent meanings still define ancestry, and only they do.** `BiologicalParent` and `AdoptiveParent` keep every meaning
0035 gave them: source parent, target child, and the only links walked for parents, grandparents, siblings, children,
grandchildren, the tree's circles and `CANON-FAMILY-001`. `RelationshipFamilySemantics.Parent` is that set, used by every
query that derives anything.

**A new meaning: `NonStructuralFamily` (3).** "This relationship belongs in the Family Tree experience, but it places
neither entry in the ancestry" - uncle, aunt, cousin, spouse, guardian, step-sibling, godparent. Stored in the existing
integer column; no schema change. *This supersedes 0035's "family semantics only represent parent relationships".*

- **Authored, never derived.** The tree lists the focal entry's non-structural links under *Other family connections*,
  each read from the focal entry's side with the kind's own words (`RelationshipValidation.LabelFor`, the one wording every
  relation list uses): *Bilbo uncle of Frodo*, and from Frodo *nephew or niece of Bilbo*. It is never walked: an "uncle
  of" makes nobody a parent, sibling, grandparent or grandchild, and LoreX never derives an uncle from parent links
  either. Derived ancestry and authored family stay two different things on screen.
- **Symmetric kinds may carry it.** A parent meaning names a side and is still refused on a symmetric kind; "married to"
  names none, so it may be non-structural and reads the same from both ends.
- **No Canon change.** `CANON-FAMILY-001` inspects parent meanings only, so two "uncle of" links in a circle are no
  finding. Relationship Canon constraints are untouched.
- **Family links remain ordinary relationships.** No table, no second relationship system, no Family Tree write endpoint.
  The tree's read still costs at most five queries: the links touching the focal entry are read once and split into
  parent links and authored ones; the next step out reads parent links only.

**A family kind is created without leaving the tree.** *Add family connection* offers *New family relationship kind*, a
dialog posting to the existing `POST .../relationship-types` with name, inverse name, symmetric and a family meaning
(default: family that does not define ancestry; biological or adoptive parent may be chosen; parent meanings are not
offered for a symmetric kind). The new kind joins the form's list and is chosen at once, with no route change. The same
dialog is offered on the tree's empty state when no family kind exists. The form follows the meaning: a parent kind asks
which side is the parent; any other family kind is read as a relation - *Bilbo [uncle of ▼] Frodo*, or the inverse
reading - and never mentions parents.

**Types is three tabs in one destination.** Lore Types, Relation Kinds, and Event Kinds & Methods, in the address as
`?tab=` (`lore` is the default and leaves it out; `relations`, `events`), every panel mounted and hidden - Settings'
pattern, now shared as `QueryTabList`/`TabPanel` and `useQueryTab`. Unlike Settings, each tab chosen is pushed as a step of
history, so Back and Forward walk the tabs; Settings keeps replacing (`useQueryTab(tabs, { history: 'push' })`). `+ New type` is the page
header's action on the Lore Types tab and opens a dialog: name, icon, Family Tree. The relation kind manager and the event
kind manager move into their tabs unchanged, apart from the new meaning in the relation kind editor.

**Backup: format version 18.** `entityTypes[].familyTreeEligible`, and `NonStructuralFamily` by name in
`relationshipTypes[].familySemantic`. A bump, not an ignorable member: a version 17 reader does not know the new meaning
and must never read it as a parent link, and eligibility is an authored choice. A file at version 17 or earlier reads each
type through the starter rule above, even if it carries a value; a file at version 17 or earlier carrying
`NonStructuralFamily` was not written by LoreX and is refused.

## Consequences

- An upgraded universe keeps every family tree it had; only its untouched Character is offered by default, and a
  species with a parent link says so on its tree instead of disappearing.
- A universe whose Character was customised offers no Family Tree picker entries until its author enables a type; the
  tree says *No Lore Type is enabled for Family Tree yet* and links to Lore Types.
- The Family Tree's picker and the connection form's picker filter on the type, so an ineligible entry can still be
  linked from its Relations view - the relation editor is not the Family Tree and filters nothing.

## Deferred

- Spouses placed inside ancestry rows, derived uncles and cousins, full and half siblings, arbitrary family graph layout,
  configurable depth. Unchanged from ADR 0035.
- Canon constraints on a kind made from the Family Tree dialog: set on the Relation Kinds tab afterwards.
- Reusing the Family Tree dialog as the Relation Kinds tab's create form: that form carries Canon constraints the dialog
  deliberately leaves out, so the two stay separate.
