# ADR 0022 - A universe keeps its own chronology: ordered eras, compared as structured points

Status: accepted (2026-09-13)

## Context

ADR 0009 stores a moment's date as signed integer components with a free-text `EraLabel` beside
them, and says plainly that cross-era ordering is not solved: the label orders nothing, so a
Second Age 3441 sorts after a Third Age 3018. ADR 0011 then had to make the chronology rules stand
down for any universe whose timeline used more than one label, because a birth year carried no era
at all and could not be placed against a moment that did.

The universes Lorex is for rarely count one way from one zero. "Before the Fall" counts down to a
catastrophe and "After the Fall" counts up from it; a third age may follow. To order those dates,
and to prove a character was born after the moment it attends, Lorex has to know which eras exist,
which comes first, and which way each one's years run - from the author, not from the words.

## Decision

**Chronology belongs to the universe, as ordered era rows.** `ChronologyEras` holds `Id`,
`UniverseId`, `Name`, `Abbreviation`, `SortOrder`, `Direction` (`Ascending` or `Descending`) and
`LabelPosition` (`BeforeYear` or `AfterYear`), cascading with the universe. Typed columns, not a
JSON blob, for the reason ADR 0007 gives: an era is referenced, ordered and joined on.

**No stored mode: a universe with no eras is the plain reckoning.** A separate "custom chronology"
flag would allow two states that mean nothing - custom with no eras, plain with eras lying around -
and would need a migration writing a row for every existing universe. The eras are the
configuration, so neither state can exist, and an existing universe is untouched until its author
names an era.

**Eras are identified by id and ordered by configuration.** A date points at an era by id, so a
rename rewords every date in it and moves none. `SortOrder` is contiguous and unique per universe,
enforced by an index; the whole list is replaced in one `PUT /api/universes/{id}/chronology`, whose
position in the list is the order, so reordering is one atomic change. Names are unique ignoring
case, and so is what is written beside a year (the short label, or the name when there is none),
because two eras must never read alike. Nothing about "before" or "after" is special-cased.

**Dates are structured, never compared as labels.**

- `TimelineEntry` gains `StartEraId` and `EndEraId`. A range may start in one era and end in another.
- `EntityFieldValue` gains `EraId` - metadata on the Number, not a new field kind. It is required on
  a `BirthYear` or `DeathYear` value in a universe that names eras, allowed on any other Number there,
  and refused in a universe that names none. `Age` stays unread (ADR 0011).
- A revision snapshot keeps `EraId` and the label written beside the year at the time, like every
  other reference in a version (ADR 0013). Moving a year to another era is an edit; renaming the era
  is not.
- Every foreign key to an era is `NO ACTION`: removing an era something is dated in is refused with
  a 409 naming what is dated there, and the key holds against a race. Nothing is cleared or
  reassigned on the author's behalf.
- A story scene's position is a year in an era too (ADR 0024, amended 2026-09-13): the same rules, the
  same `NO ACTION` key, and it counts as a use. It is display metadata on narrative and no rule reads it.

**One comparison.** `ChronologyPoint` reduces a date to `(EraRank, Year, Month, Day)`: the era's
`SortOrder`, the year negated when the era counts down, then month and day with an absent one as 0.
The timeline's range check and all three chronology rules compare these; the timeline listing's SQL
ordering is the same key written as a query, and a test holds the query and the comparer to the same
answer over eras of both directions. Months and days ascend even inside a year that counts down.

**Year zero.** Inside an era, a year is whole and counts from 1 - no 0, no negatives. The era carries
what a sign would, and "BF 0" beside "AF 0" would name a moment no author asked for. The plain
reckoning keeps signed years including 0, exactly as ADR 0009 has them. Allowing 0 inside eras later
would be an additive relaxation; forbidding it after the fact would not be, which is why it starts
forbidden.

**The plain reckoning is unchanged.** With no eras, dates are signed years with an optional free-text
label, listed in the same order, and the chronology rules still stand down when that label takes more
than one value. Every existing test of that behaviour runs unmodified.

**A year written before the eras is not guessed at.** Naming eras rewrites nothing. A dated moment or
a birth year that carries no era is off the line: the listing puts such moments after every placed
one and before unknown dates, the client shows them apart as having no era yet, the rules ignore
them, and saving one again requires choosing its era. Settings reports how many there are.

**A chronology change is gated.** Reordering eras or turning one around re-places everything dated
in them at once, so the write runs under the promotion gate (ADR 0012) and is refused if it would
introduce a High finding.

**Display follows the configuration, in one formatter per side.** A year in an era is written with
its short label, or its name, on the side `LabelPosition` says: `BF 10`, `10 Third Age`. The API's
`UniverseChronology.FormatYear` writes Canon explanations; the client's `chronology/format.ts` writes
every date on screen. Month and day stay numeric (ADR 0009).

**Version 1 stops short of a calendar engine.** No month names, month lengths, leap years, seasons,
weekdays, clocks, multiple calendars per universe or conversion between calendars. Month and day are
already stored components and already part of the point; richer calendar work extends the era or
universe configuration, the point's lower components and the formatter, rather than replacing any
of them.

## Consequences

- Cross-era ordering is solved for every universe that names its eras, and the chronology rules
  compare across eras instead of standing down. ADR 0009's and ADR 0011's limits now apply only to
  the plain reckoning.
- The listing joins to the start era to sort. The composite index no longer carries the whole order
  for a universe with eras; that is acceptable at SQLite's scale and belongs to the PostgreSQL work.
- The migration rebuilds `TimelineEntries` and `EntityFieldValues`, as SQLite requires to add a
  foreign key. Every row is copied as it stands. Rolling it back discards the eras, and every year
  written in one reads as a plain year again - the only meaning the older schema has for it.
- Years written before the eras must be given one by hand, one entry at a time. There is no bulk
  assignment yet, and no reassignment tool for moving everything out of an era before removing it.
- A backup carries the eras and every era reference, which makes it format version 4 (ADR 0014).
